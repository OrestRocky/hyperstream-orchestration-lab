# hyperstream-orchestration-lab
HyperStream Orchestration Lab is a reference architecture for real-time AI systems operating under extreme data intensity. It demonstrates how to orchestrate multi-model pipelines, synchronize high-frequency data streams, and integrate human-in-the-loop feedback for safe, cost-aware, and adaptive decision-making.
